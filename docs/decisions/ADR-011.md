# ADR-011: Agent-Framework Agnostic Design

Date: 2026-02-11
Status: Accepted

## Context

The governance architecture was initially built on and for Nonaxis. However, the core problem — governing autonomous agent execution — applies to every framework that gives LLMs tool access. Coupling to one framework limits adoption and creates unnecessary dependencies.

The current codebase has Nonaxis-specific assumptions in the Operator's interceptor, the SOUL.md-based agent configuration, and the skill format.

## Decision

Design the bus protocol, token spec, and Arbiter API to be agent-framework agnostic from Phase 2 onward. Framework-specific adapters (Nonaxis, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain) are plugins, not core.

## Rationale

1. **Broader applicability.** The agent execution governance problem applies to every framework that gives LLMs tool access. Coupling to one framework is unnecessarily limiting.
2. **Enterprise adoption.** Large organizations will use multiple agent frameworks. A governance layer that only covers one is incomplete coverage.
3. **Technical feasibility.** The core abstractions (action classification, policy evaluation, token-gated execution, audit logging) are already framework-independent in concept. The coupling is in the adapter layer, not the core.

## Consequences

- The bus protocol needs a formal spec (not just implementation) that any framework can implement against.
- The token format becomes a public contract, not an internal detail.
- The Operator adapter becomes a plugin interface: `classify(action) → tier`, `submit(action) → review_request`.
- Phase 2 scope increases, but long-term maintenance decreases (cleaner abstractions).
